Abby will prepare an around five minutes speech and each participant need to be an evaluator for giving any feedback to the host. After that, we can have a discussion based on the host's presentation content or have a free talk. I won't let you know what is the topic of the speech for now because sometimes we need the surprise to abundant our life ðŸ¥°
