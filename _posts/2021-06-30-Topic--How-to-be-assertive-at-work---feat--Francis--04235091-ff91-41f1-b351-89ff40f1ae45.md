# Quick questions before discussion
We would really appreciate if you could take just a few minutes to respond to the questions below by 8pm June 30. Click the link below to respond.



Have you ever attended a business meeting, a presentation, or a conference call in English where you didn’t really feel that you contributed ?
Perhaps you were silent when you wanted to speak. Perhaps you didn’t know how to get involved and participate. If you find it difficult to express your opinions. And you’d like to know how to communicate assertively, this event is perfect for you.
You will learn 3 communication skills you can easily use to express your ideas or opinions in English diplomatically.
# The Agenda:
## 9.pm - 9.10pm
For the first 10 minutes, you will have the chance to relax, mingle with participants.
## 9.10pm - 9.20pm
Then I will deliver a 10-minute presentation describing 4 basic communication styles and 3 communication languages you can use to express your ideas and opinions politely in English.
## 9.20pm - 9.35pm
We will summarize a 11-minute YouTube video regarding how to be assertive at work and later discuss questions. These questions are based on contents from this video. 
## 9.35pm - 9.50pm
During group discussion time, I’ve designed some interactive and fun learning activities. I will state the question or topic briefly and then call on a participant at random to respond. As a participant, you may give your response according to your personal experience. And we will invite another participant to share his/her ideas or opinions toward the previous speakers’ using the communication skills we’ve learned.
## 9.50pm - 10.pm
Before we end our event, I will summarize what we learned and we can discuss your insights and get your constructive feedback.
# What should you expect?
The most important thing in any learning event is that you don’t feel nervous. You need to feel comfortable, relaxed and you should enjoy your time. We will make sure to create a friendly and supportive learning environment.
# What should you bring?
You don’t need to bring anything.
# English or Chinese?
This event is conducted in English (90%) and Mandarin(10%).
We encourage you to speak English as much as you could.
# How will you benefit from attending this event?
By the end of this event, you will know how to use a number of communication strategies so that you feel comfortable and confident actively participating in business conversations and discussions. You will get valuable information about western business culture and you will have the opportunity to practice your English, to improve your vocabulary and improve your fluency. You will also have fun !
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
