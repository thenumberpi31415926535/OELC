#                                  Introduction
Everyone is expecting to encounter some sort of conflict while talking to people, but how do we solve it? And what should we do when we have one? So this time, we are going to talk about conflicts and provide you with some useful tips!


Our discussion will include but not limited to the following:
## What are conflicts?
## Are conflicts always bad? What are your experiences?
## Should we avoid conflicts?
## What do you do when you face conflicts? Some useful tips!


For sure, if you're afraid that your English might not be good enough, or you feel unconfident about speaking English, etc., we also welcome you to sign up for an audience seat. By the way, we may accept some more speakers at the very beginning of the show, or during the show, so don't worry if you've signed up for an audience but you then found you want to share something with us.

!!!By the way, if you suddenly find you will have to miss our show but you’ve signed up for it already, please tell us before the show starts, cheers.
If you have any questions, please contact the hosts. Or fill in the feedback form we provide at the end of each show. In either way, we’ll be able to know your demands and contact you individually.
