Hiiii it has been a while for me to not open a talk!!!
It is time for us to get a reunionü•∞ü•∞üëåüèª

Since I was an exchange student in the US in 2019, I would like to open this session for you to ask me any questions about my experience there! Then, I can share it or have a discussion with everyone! I usually won't type too much here so let's meet and see how it goes!
