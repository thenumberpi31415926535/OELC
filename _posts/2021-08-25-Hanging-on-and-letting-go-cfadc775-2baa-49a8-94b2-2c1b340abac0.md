   - Do you ever have to let go of something or someone that was a tough decision for you? Why?



   - Do you worry other people's opinion for the decisions you make?
   - What advice can you give to people who are still making that decision?
   - Why do we hang on to things or finding it difficult to let go?
   - Imagine a world full of people whom are no longer sentimental?
