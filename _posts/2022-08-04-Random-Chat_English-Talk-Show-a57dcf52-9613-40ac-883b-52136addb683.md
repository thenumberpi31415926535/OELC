Hello guys, it’s been a really long time since we last talked!!! My partner and I have been extremely these weeks, and couldn’t squeeze some time to host shows. But now we’re back!!!

Tonight we may talk a bit about different parties’ perspectives towards the interpreter’s performance, as well as Nancy Pelosi’s visiting to Taiwan!!! If you have any thought, welcome to join us. It may also be a free talk session if no one’s interested in talking about such serious topics. Just come in and see how it goes!!

If you have any other questions, please contact the hosts. Or fill in the feedback form we provide at the end of each show. In either way, we’ll be able to know your demands and contact you individually.
