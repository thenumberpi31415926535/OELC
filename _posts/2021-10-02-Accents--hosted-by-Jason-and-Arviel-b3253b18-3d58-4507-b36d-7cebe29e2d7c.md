##                                                  Introduction
When we're learning English, probably, a lot of us are struggling with some questions about "accent" and "pronunciation". But which one is more important? Or does having an accent really matter? And so on. On this Saturday afternoon, we'll be talking about mainly "accent", and we've invited some guests whose English is extremely good to talk about this with us. We'll be doing it as an interview, which means those guests will take turns answering the questions that we brainstormed. And we will have a Q&A session at the end of the show. So bring your questions to us if you have any. 

By the way, most of them are actually English teachers, so don't worry if you feel that you won't get the practical or correct answer. 

!!! If you suddenly find you will have to miss our show but you’ve signed up for it already, please tell us before the show starts, cheers.
And if you have any questions, please contact the hosts. Or fill in the feedback form we provide at the end of each show. In either way, we’ll be able to know your demands and contact you individually.
