# Art Salon
Imagine you are joining the salon in 18th centuries, we are going to talk about artwork this week!
The person who want to join have to prepare one of his/her favorite artworks and introduce this masterpiece to everyone. (At least tell us the name of the painting and the painter!)
Then we will discuss the painting and exchange our ideas of this work!
To make sure everyone has the chance to share, we can only have 5 speakers this week!
Hope to see you in the Sunday morning, and enjoy the wonderful artworks together!
Here is a website which may be helpful for you to find some idea of your favorite work:  [https://artsandculture.google.com/category/art-movement](https://artsandculture.google.com/category/art-movement)
