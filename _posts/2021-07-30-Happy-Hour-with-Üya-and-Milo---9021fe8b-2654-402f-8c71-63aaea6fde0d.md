We love Friday Happy Hour sessions! With the world's rapid changes, we now work with much faster pace than we used to. Motivation then became an important element in our lives to keep us going.  In today's happy hour, we want to talk about motivation and how you keep yourself motivated. 

Why is motivation important?
It has been proven by scientists that having a high level of motivation can improve our lives. Motivation is created as we set goals, strive for achievements and power. Motivation also reflects something unique about each one of us. It allows us to gain valued outcomes like improved performance, enhanced well-being, personal growth or a sense of purpose. If we use motivation appropriately, it can change our way of thinking, feeling and behaving.
Grab a drink of your choice, come and join and share how you keep yourselves motivated!
