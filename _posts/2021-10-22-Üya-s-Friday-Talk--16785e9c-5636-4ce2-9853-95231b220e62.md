Hi Guys! 
We love our Happy Hour sessions! It's been a while... but I'm so excited to be back on the show this Friday!  

In today's show I've invited my very talented friend who's been teaching in England and China. 
we will be talking about the  differences in learning and teaching English between Chinese speakers and speakers of other languages .  


# The Host

# The Guest Speaker
