We will discuss the following but not limited to:
   - Does it affect your body image? Or expected to have a certain lifestyle?
   - What features on social media would you like to add in order to make it healthier for users?
   - Do you compare yourself with those people on social media?
   - Do you think that social media glorifies disorders?
   - Do you think people live a different life on and off of social media?
